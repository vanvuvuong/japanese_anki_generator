["中学の時は普段から毎日３時間だか勉強している陸上部の友達がいて、そいつはテスト前もそのペースは崩さなかった。部活ない分かえって暇になるということで、テスト前になると毎日そいつん家でゲームをしてた。あれがなけりゃ俺ももう少し好成績取れたはずだが。 → When I was in middle school, I had a friend in the track club who normally studied 3 hours a day. He didn't speed up the pace before tests. On the contrary, he didn't have any club activities and so had lot of free time, so before the test we would go to his house and play video games every day. If we hadn't done that, I would have gotten better grades too."]
